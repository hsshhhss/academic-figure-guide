# Academic Figure Guide
Han's personal experience on generating academic figures for publications.

## General Rules 

1. Use vector graph whenever it is possible.

    There are basically two types of figure format. One is *vector* (e.g., svg, eps) and the other one is *bitmap* (e.g., jpg, png). 
    When we write papers, we should use *vector* format whenever it is possible, since it is relatively lightweight and does not get pixelated when zoomed in. 
    An example is provided in `examples/eps-vs-png`. In this example, we compare the same matplotlib figure in *.eps* and *.png* format. 
    We also provide a brief guide on how we can include *.eps* figures. 

    Note that if the figure you use is taken by a camera, then it is not necessary to transform it to vector map, since it will get pixelated anyway.

1. Font consistency.
1. Print-ability.
